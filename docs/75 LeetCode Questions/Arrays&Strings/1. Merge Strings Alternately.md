## 1768. Merge Strings Alternately
**Description**: 
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

### Example 1:
**Input:** word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
**Output:** "apbqcr"

**Explanation:** The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

### Example 2:
**Input:** word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
**Output:** "apbqrs"

**Explanation:** Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

### Example 3:
**Input:** word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
**Output:** "apbqcd"

**Explanation:** Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d

**C++ Code**:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string result = "";  // Resultant merged string
        int i = 0, j = 0;    // Indices for word1 and word2

        // Alternating merge until one of the words is exhausted
        while (i < word1.size() && j < word2.size()) {
            result += word1[i++];  // Add from word1
            result += word2[j++];  // Add from word2
        }

        // Append any remaining characters from word1
        while (i < word1.size()) {
            result += word1[i++];
        }

        // Append any remaining characters from word2
        while (j < word2.size()) {
            result += word2[j++];
        }

        return result;
    }
};

```
