# Factorial Recursion Depth

The factorial of a number can be calculated using recursion, with each recursive call reducing the problem size by 1 until it reaches the base case.

## Example Code
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

### Explanation of the Code

- **Base Case**: The function returns `1` when \( n \) is 0 or 1, which stops the recursion.
- **Recursive Calculation**: Each call to `factorial(n)` results in a call to `factorial(n - 1)`, building up the multiplication as the stack unwinds.

### Importance of Recursion Depth in Factorial Calculations

Understanding recursion depth in the factorial function is important because:

- **Efficiency**: The maximum recursion depth equals the input \( n \), leading to \( O(n) \) time complexity.
- **Memory Consumption**: Each recursive call adds to the stack, so for large \( n \), the program may run into stack overflow issues.
- **Optimization**: Using an iterative approach can prevent deep recursion.

### Practical Example of Recursion Depth

For an input value of 5, the maximum recursion depth is:

\[
\text{depth} = 5
\]

### Tips for Managing Recursion Depth in Factorial Calculations

1. **Using an Iterative Approach**: Consider using a loop to calculate factorials instead of recursion to avoid stack overflow.
2. **Memory Considerations**: Ensure that the environment can handle the expected recursion depth.
3. **Testing with Edge Cases**: Validate the function with values like 0, 1, and larger numbers to ensure it performs as expected.
